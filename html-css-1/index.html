            <p>Elephants, the largest existing land animals, are mammals of the family Elephantidae. Three species are
                currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant.
                Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; extinct members include the
                mastodons.
                The family Elephantidae also contains several now-extinct groups, including the mammoths and
                straight-tusked
                elephants. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller
                ears,
                and convex or level backs. Distinctive features of all elephants include a long trunk, tusks, large ear
                flaps, massive legs, and tough but sensitive skin. The trunk, also called a proboscis, is used for
                breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the
                incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps
                assist
                in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. The pillar-like legs carry their
                great weight.</p>
